# Front-end Home Assignment

Welcome to WSC Front-end Home Assignment.

Your task is to implement the `<MultiSelect />` Component so it will behave like a modern Multi-select component as described and designed in the provided Zeplin project.

The Zeplin project is shared with the Zeplin user given in mail.

You can ignore the adding of options (The create tag feature), the warning state, the loading state and the disabled state for now.

## Bonus part

Implement these keyboard interactions:

* Pressing `BACKSPACE` when the input is *FOCUSED* and empty, and there are selected options before the cursor, should remove the last option, like you would delete a character.
* `UP` and `DOWN` keys should navigate through the suggested options in the autocomplete menu with the same feedback as a cursor hover would generate.
* `ENTER` should select an option if the user navigated to it with the arrow keys and hide the autocomplete list like a cursor selection would to.
